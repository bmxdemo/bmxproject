## April 21, 2017: Amplifier chain S-param and noise temperature measurement
Christopher D. Sheehy

### 1 - Introduction

This is a first crack at putting together the amplifier chain and measuring the
noise temperature.

<hr>

### 2 - S-parameters of individual components


The last -30 dB attenuator is because the VNA is overloaded before the 1 dB
compression point of the system is reached. All the S21 params are therefore -30
dB. (I checked and it is a very flat -30 dB attenuation.)

Justine previously measured the Lorch filter S-params in [this
posting](../20170327_LorchFilterMeasurements/index.md). They match the specs. I
also checked the LNA S-params and they match the [Minicircuits spec
sheet](https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/ZX60-P33ULN+.pdf) 
exactly, including S21, S11, and 1 dB compression point. I also checked AMP2 and
it has ~40 dB gain and 1 dB compression point where it's expected. So everything
seems good. 

The lowpass filter is specified as 1350 MHz, which below our band, but it has a
very slow roll off and doesn't go to zero until 2400 MHz. See [this plot](lowpass.png) of the
lowpass S11 and S21.

I measured the S params of the low loss MECA coupler as well. **Figure 1** shows the thru
S-params, with VNA port 1 at "out" and VNA port 2 and "IN", and the 30 dB port terminated.

**Figure 2** shows the same measurement but for a thru configuration with no
  coupler. It has the same adapters, so it measures the loss we expect from the
  coupler. (Note the adapter in Fig 1a is required between the coupler and LNA
  because both are male.

Opening Fig 1b and Fig 2b in separate tabs and blinking between them shows a
shift in S21 of ~-0.1 dB caused by the coupler. This is very low loss, and in fact
is the loss stated in the MECA data sheet (that's why we bought it). It
corresponds to an added noise temperature of 7 K. I should
repeat this because (1) I can export the data and plot the difference, and (2) I
should be able to get less noise in S21. I did a thru calibration, but for some
reason it refuses to zero S21 better. Obviously, the S21 structure isn't noise
because it repeats between the two measurements.

**Figure 3** shows the coupler S-params, but now terminating the "out" port and
  puting VNA port 1 at the 30 dB port. We see a nice, relatively flat -30 dB
  coupling across the band.

### 3 - S-parameters of amplifier chain

Next, I assembled the amplifier chain as in **Figure 4**:

coupler -> LNA -> -3dB -> filter -> AMP2 -> lowpass -> -30 dB

Port 1 of the VNA is at the input to the coupler. Port 2 is the output of the
chain. The 30 dB port of the coupler is connected to a signal generator which is
off, which is exactly the same as if it is terminated.

  </tr>
  </table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

**Figure 5** shows the resulting S-parameters. S11 matches the LNA S11 from the
  spec sheet. S21 is 20 dB. Accounting for the -30 dB attenuator, the system has
  50 dB gain. The LNA has ~17 dB gain and the second stage amp has ~40 dB
  gain. With the 3 dB attenuator, we expect ~54 dB, so this is about right.

**Figure 6** shows a power sweep of S21 at 1.3 GHz. The system starts to become nonlinear
  at -44 dBm input, with a 1 dB compression point at -37 dBm input. The 1 dB
  compression point of the second amp is lower than the LNA, so it is the second
  amp that is certainly driving it. For reference, 300 K blackbody is -174 dBm /
  Hz. Over 1 GHz, this is -174 + 90 = -84 dBm, so we are in no danger of
  non-linearity. We'll have to see what happens with RFI.

**Figure 7** shows S-params with the coupler input terminated and port 1 of the
  VNA at the 30 dB coupled port. S11 is low and S21 is the same as the amp chain
  S21 but reduced by 30 dB, as hoped for.

### 4 - Spectrometer data

I then terminated the input of the chain and terminated the coupled port. I
removed the 30 dB attenuator and connected the output of the chain to channel 1
of the spectrometer. The spectrometer samples at 1100 MHz, putting our 1100 -
1650 MHz band in the third nyquist zone, and appearing at 0-550 MHz.  I
connected a signal generator outputting a tone just above 1100 MHz and connected
it to port 2 of the spectrometer. I failed to write down the power of the tone,
but it is ~ -20 dBm. **Figure 8a** shows the result.  The top row
is channel 1. The **left column** is the spectrum and the x-axis is in MHz. The
**right column** shows 512 time samples of the raw sampled voltage. We are using
2 or 3 bits of dynamic range. The bottom row is channel 2, which shows the
spectrum of a pure tone directly connected to it.

**Figure 8b** shows the same thing but with the input open. Now, instead of 300
  K going throug the amp chain, the LNA noise is reflected off the open input
  and amplified. The LNA noise is supposed to be 20 K, which is why the signal
  goes down.

<p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tr><th rowspan="2">Fig.&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</th>
      <th colspan="2">Spectrometer data</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td align="center"><b>a. terminated input </b> </td>
      <td align="center"><b>b. open input</b> </td>

  </tr>
  </table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


I then hooked a second signal generator up to the input of the chain and tuned
the power output until it matched the direct spectrum. The power at which this
occured is -70 dBm, which corresponds to 200 uV p-p. This makes sense given that
the directly connected signal generator is at -20 dBm and the system gain is
~50. The spectrometer data is shown in **Figure 9**.

<p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

  </tr>
  </table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

Lastly, I terminated the amp chain input and hooked the signal generator (still
outputting -70 dBm) up to the 30 dB coupled port. The result is shown in
**Figure 10**. The peak is reduced by 30 dBm, as expected. You can now just see
the thermal noise instead of a line at zero. It's impressive how narrow
bandwidth the tone is. Even though it dominates the power spectrum, the total
amount of power appears to still be dominated by the thermal noise.

### 5 - Noise temperature measurement

I measured the noise temperature by terminating the input of the amp chain at 50
ohms and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. The setup is shown in **Figure 11**.
I connectorized a short length of ultra
low loss semi-rigid coax, and measured its loss to be <0.1 dB. I connected one
end to the input of the coupler and the other to a 50 ohm terminator. I need to
submerge the terminator in LN2 so it needs to face down. I therefore installed a
right angle connector after the LNA. Because it is after the LNA it should have
no effect on the noise temperature. I do not use any of the S-parameters from
the previous sections, so the slight change in setup should not affect anything.
The 30 dB coupled port is connected to the signal generator, but it is off.

**Figure 12** shows the results. The **top left** panel shows the power measured
  in one frequency bin as a function of time. It is a little strange that it
  doesn't seem to perfectly bottom out at a constant once the resistor gets to
  77 K. (It definitely stopped boiling.) My theory is that the coax and coupler
  and LNA slowly cool a bit from the thermal link (the coax is very thick)
  and the boiloff, and so the noise continues to go down a bit. Nevertheless, it
  is clear that the terminator is at 77 K. The vertical dashed lines show the
  windows in which I average the spectra to get the 290 K and 77 K spectrum.

The **top right** panel shows the average room temperature and 77 K spectra. I
then assume that power (in ADU^2) is linearly proportional to temperature, which is true in
the Rayleigh–Jeans limit (h nu << kT) which we are certainly in. In each
frequency bin I calculate the slope of P(T), which gets me the gain of the
system in ADU^2 / K. I then compute the y-intercept (at T=0) which gives me the
zero point temperature (i.e. the noise temperature) in ADU^2, which I convert to
K given the gain. I plot this noise temperature in the **lower left**
panel. I also plot the noise temperature for a second measurement I made
removing the coupler and hooking the terminated coax directly to the LNA input. 

The **lower right** panel shows each of the individual spectra during the
cooldown and warmup (each 100th, actually) now calibrated to temperature
units. The fact that they are flat at all temperatures is a nice check.

The noise temperature measurements are too high for the LNA specs, which is
supposed to have 20 K noise. Obviously, the next thing to do is to try another
LNA, but given that the LNA S-parameters and 1 dB compression were in spec, I'd
be surprised if ours were broken. I should also try getting rid of the down
chain amplifier and seeing if there is enough gain to measure the LNA by
itself.

Nicely, eyballing this plot, we see that the coupler adds ~8K noise. This
corresponds to 0.11 dB of loss, which is what I measured in Figures 1-2. This
gives me confidence I'm doing the measurement correctly (I've done it before,
correctly, also). Unfortunately, it seems that the high noise temperature is
probably real, too.

### 6 - Conclusions

* The amp chain has 50 dB of gain and 1 dB compression point @ -37 dBm input
* The S-parameters of all individual components seem to make sense and match specs
* 300 K takes up 2-3 bits of dynamic range. We want 1-2 bits, but the signal
  will be smaller on the sky, so this seems about right. We shouldn't need
  **more** gain, at least.
* The behavior of the 30 dB coupled port makes sense
* The noise temperaure is 100-150 K, is supposed to be ~20 K. This is the most
  urgent issue that needs to be understood. Possibly just bad amp.
* The coupler adds ~8 K noise temperature, as expected.
