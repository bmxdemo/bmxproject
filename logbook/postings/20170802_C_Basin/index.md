### August 2, 2017 - Basin absorber/no absorber tests
Chandler Conn

### Introduction
Continuing from [this post](postings/20170720_OMT_in_basin/index.md) I present some interesting data. One of the data points that we took out in the basin was a ninefold measurement of various conditions:

The regions are as follows: 

|Junk|
|:---:|
|**Absorber**|
|**Open (pointing to sky)**|
|**1/8'' Delrin**|
|**1/16'' Delrin**|
|**1/8'' Acrylic**|
|**1/16'' Acrylic**|
|**2'' Acrylic (on a 1/16'' sheet)**|
|**Open**|

Unusually, when the 300k absorber load is placed in front of the OMT, we see a damping of the signal. Let's examine this in closer detail:

One of the blue trials I gathered was fairly noisy or potentially RFI-infected, but the general trend still holds. Each color has ~4 plots behind it if I remember correctly, so as to make sure I wasn't getting a bad plot of each.
