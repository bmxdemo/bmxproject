## Mar 30, 2018 - Coupled Port Measurements Indicate Instability

### Motivation: Potential Return to OMT Coupled Ports?

After our discussion a few weeks ago, we decided to remove the low loss
cable/30dB coupler/noise diode setup in favor of putting the noise diode on the
OMT coupler ports. This change was made, as mentioned previously, on March 14th
2018, when the coupling between the coupled port and receiver port were quite
high. Within the data browser, calibration methods are applied using the
measured S21 between the coupled port and receiver port, and since a change was
made, a new measurement of this parameter had to be conducted. Simultaneously,
there was a suggestion to adjust the insertion depth of the coupled
copper-jacketed coax, which injects the noise diode signal into the OMT, where
it is mixed into the sky signal. 

To accomplish both of these objectives, I did the following on Tuesday, March
27th 2018. First, I removed the low loss cables and the noise diodes from all of
the OMT ports, and took S21 measurements across the coupled/receiver ports on
both channels. Then, I loosened the aluminum clamps which 'hold' the calibration
coaxial cables inside the OMT, and adjusted their depth (no more than a few
millimeters) until the VNA indicated that the S21 across the ports was roughly
-30dB within the band. I then secured the coax cables, acquired another S21
measurement across the ports, and finally reconnected the noise diodes and low
loss cables to the required ports. The results of these measurements are shown
below: 




### Experimental Configuration:

These frequency sweeps were all performed using the Spartant signal generator
(with 2 Low Pass filters on the RF output, to attenuate high frequency harmonics
by ~80dB,) locked to the 10MHz signal output by a lab signal generator  which
also clocked the ROACH FPGA. The frequency sweeps were all performed from 25MHz
- 600MHz with a 1MHz step, at a power of +13dBm. To keep our system consistent,
I performed these tests using the amp chain I constructed on the bench, with a
2.9V supply. The amp chain is arranged as it has been in the past, and is
identical to the amp chain on the bench:

~~~
  -------------------------
  OMT/Terminator/Spartant+2LP
  -------------------------
  Band Pass Filter 1
  LNA 1 	
  3dB Attenuator
  LNA 2	
  Low Pass Filter (VLFX-1350)
  Stage 3 Amplifier
  [**When OMT, attach 10dB Attenuator**]

  ROACH FPGA

These tests were first conducted on the bench, and then in the basin. The
fundamental setup was the same. First, I performed a direct injection of the
frequency sweep from the signal generator directly into the amp chain. Second, I
terminated the amp chain and broadcast the frequency sweep through the log
periodic, looking for direct coupling to the amp chain components. Finally, I
connected the OMT (from the lab) into the amp chain, and broadcast the frequency
sweep directly into the OMT.
