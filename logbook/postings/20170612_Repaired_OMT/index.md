### Introduction
Continuing in the same vein as [an earlier posting from Chris](../20170321_new_omt "Click me! :)"), much of this posting will be bookkeeping and present data from the rebuilt version of two OMTs (A and B). The rebuild was necessary due to damage suffered in transit from Michigan that affected the coaxial conductor. Nothing else was changed about the OMT--no new design was implemented and as much detail as I could muster was put into rebuilding with care.
