### Repaired OMT S-Parameter (pt. 2) and loss measurements

### Introduction
In my [last post](http://github.com/bmxdemo/bmxproject/logbook/postings/20170612_Repaired_OMT/index.md "last measurements") I gathered the S11 measurements from the rebuilt OMTs and found that they were very similar to Chris's [earlier measurements](../20170321_new_omt/index.md "Click me! :)"). This posting is a simple continuation whereby I will gather the S12 parameters and subsequently the loss of the rebuilt OMTs.

### S12 measurements
The data gathering methods are exactly the same as they were earlier. Simple photos and data will be presented:
