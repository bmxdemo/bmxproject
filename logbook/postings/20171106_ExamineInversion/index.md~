## Nov 6, 2017 - Attenuators on Digitizer Ports

### Palantir 2 Channel Card Status: Alive and Kicking

In my [last posting](../20171106_ResolvedPortIssues/index.md) I exposed that the
digitizer card works properly, but that the data cable connecting to the port
was not properly inserted. Consequently, all data from 10/27 - 11/05 is not
significant. By reconnecting the cable to the digitizer port with the
3dB attenuator, the electrical connection was actually made, and the overall
power level decreased by a factor of 2 from before the cable was improperly
connected.



In this time series plot from [the posting outlining the
issue](../20171101_DamagedPorts/index.md), the system goes from well behaved and
stable, to a state I defined as 'inverted'.

The reason for these drastic system changes was trivial -- a faulty electrical
connection between the 15ft data cable and the digitizer card, and does not seem
to be due to internal damage on the digitizer ports.

My initial suspicion was that the oscillatory behavior in the
spectra was due to a poor connecton with the damaged port causing significant
reflections within the 15 foot cable. To test this suspicion, I sought to
compare the terminated and on sky spectra from the digitizer card and the signal
hound. At the conclusion of these measurements, I reconnected the data cable to
the digitizer card, with the addition of a 3dB attenuator. My motivation for
adding the attenuator was to dissipate any reflected signal. 

After restarting data acquisition, I found the shape of the spectra had returned
to its former glory, and that the total power was reduced by a factor of 2 from
the initial level from my last posting, due to the added 3dB attenuator. This
discovery rendered the SignalHound measurements moot, but they indicated that
the amplifier chain was operating as expected.

### Current Configuration:

As before, the OMT+Horn is connected via low-loss cable to the output port of a
30dB coupler operating in reverse. The noise diode is connected to the 30dB
port. The input port of the 30dB coupler is connected via low-loss cable to the
amplifier chain as follows:

BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> 3ft Cable -> BP -> Data Cable

As stated earlier, this data cable connects to a 3dB attenuator, which is
attached to the digitizer card port. Chris suggested placing attenuators on all
digitizer ports in the future, to reduce reflections in the data cables and to
protect the port from an excessive amount of connection/reconnection.

### Spectrometer Data Acquisiton from 11/06:

This time series plot shows the data files collected on 11/06 in the process of
debugging the system:

Frequency Bins are the same as before:

1) f1300 = 1274.62MHz - (Green)
2) f1500 = 1301.48MHz - (Red)
3) f2000 = 1368.62MHz - (Blue)
4) f3000 = 1502.89MHz - (Cyan)

I was convinced that I had destroyed the card ports, and I sought to prove
it by comparing spectra collected with the digitier card to spectra generated
with the SignalHound.
