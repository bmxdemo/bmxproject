## Feb 27, 2018 - Experimental Configuration for NS Interferometry:

Today at 2:20 PM, Paul Stankus and I went out to the basin and made some changes
to the current setup. First, The second channel (Y-pol, Horizontal) has been moved from
the OMT to the log-periodic antenna, oriented North-South, at a distance of ~222
inches. In theory, this should not produce fringes in response to an east-west
transiting source. Second, another band-pass filter has been added to each chain
before the first LNA. If there are intermodulation products from out of band
frequencies, these should be attenuated further, and the response to transiting
sources (if they are intermodulation proucts from out of band) will be reduced.  

Below is a log of notes from these changes:

Adding second bandpass to front of both polarizations/amp chains
	Placing second bandpass at front should tamp down out of band frequencies
	If intermodulation is coming in from high/low frequency power, this should reduce blob power 
Configure log-periodic antenna on second amp chain/data stream
	This will continue previous interferometric tests, choose NS baseline, expect no fringing
	This should be a strong test of intermodulation products as well

Tuesday 180227 2:20-2:28 PM
Remove channel 2 Y-Pol Horiz from OMT, and connect it to the log-periodic
Add second band-pass filter to beginning of both amp chains (before previous first bandpass)â€¦

Additionally, Paul and I took some basic measurements to attempt to quantify the
east-west orientation of the OMT+Horn relative to the dish. Measurements were
taken from the bottom-inside corner of the horn, and a tape measure was
stretched to mounting screws at 4 positions on the dish. These measurements
indicate that the orientation is not perfect, as suspected.

1) West bottom-corner of horn to west screw on outermost short panel: 370.6cm
2) West bottom-corner of horn to west screw on outermost long panel: 459.0cm
3) East bottom-corner of horn to East screw on outermost short panel: 376.6cm
4) East bottom-corner of horn to East screw on outermost long panel: 463.9cm
