## Sep 15, 2017: OMT S-Parameter Measurements in Basin

On Sep 11, 2017, I used the VNA to measure the S-parameters of the OMT in the
basin, pointing at the freshly joined dish. These results can be directly
compared to the [OMT S11 data previously collected by chris](../20170321_new_omt/index.md), both in a lab
setting with the OMT directed into an absorber, and created in simulations.

### S11 Measurements

First, the VNA was calibrated, and then connected with Port 1 on the Y [chan2]
polarization low loss cable. Signal from the VNA was 'broadcast' through the
horn, and the measurement of S11 will tell us the amount of signal that is being
reflected off the OMT+Horn and dish, back into the low-loss cable.

In this configuration, Chris positioned a 48"x48" aluminum sheet at various
positions relative to the dish and the OMT. Conceptually, if the beam of the OMT
was seeing outside the surface of the dish, changing the geometry of the dish
would change the reflected power. Control measurements were taken before each
alteration,

### Comparison: Before and After:

Here is a log space plot comparing the data from the previous posting (before
the dish was joined) and with the current data.
