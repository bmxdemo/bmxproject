## Oct 12, 2017: Diode Troubleshooting

### Data Acquisition with nSamples = 1000:

In my [previous posting](../20171012_DiodeTest) I left off with a description of
the data acquisition that ran over the weekend (10/13-10/16). The daq runs for 1000 samples
(~2 minutes) and then restarts itself. This was specified in the executable file
by changing the nSamples variable from 0 (infinite samples) to 1000 (stop after
1000 samples are collected.) The goal was to observe the impact of a hard reset
on the digitizer level, if all other parameters were held approximately
constant. The "signal" was the noise diode connected to the low-loss cable, with
23dB of attenuation, meaning there is no variability due to RFI, the sky,
etc. This data acquisition ran all weekend, and was stopped on monday around 5:00 PM. 

The system was configured as before:

Noise Diode --> 23dB Atten. --> Low-Loss --> [Amp Chain] --> [Spectrometer]

Analysis of these data files indicated slight variations in power were possible
by restarting the daq, without changing any other parameters.

### 
For the ominous weekend starting Oct 13, the data acquisition will be running on
1000 sample runs, with the daq stopping at the end of each 1000 samples and
restarting itself, as though it were being manually cancelled and
reset. Hopefully this will give us some indication of the implications of
stopping and restarting the system as it pertains to state changes and
stability.

The diode_test_files.ini file is being called by the diode_exec.sh executable,
which seems to be working as of tonight at 6:30 pm. This creates a new data file
every ~2 minutes, where the signal on channel 1 is a terminator with no
band-pass filter, and the signal on channel 2 is the noise diode + 23dB
attenuation connected to the low loss cable in the configuration at the top of
this posting. Paul Stankus suggested more rigorous conventions regarding the
configuration of the amp chain, and it seems like a reasonable and wise request.
