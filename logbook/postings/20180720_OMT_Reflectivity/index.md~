## July 20, 2018 - Measurements of OMT Transmission/Reflectivity

### Introduction and Motivation:



In making progress toward the satellite transit analysis, another step is to
calibrate out the transmission/reflectivity effects of the OMT+Horn. On Tuesday,
July 10th 2018, during the process of dissassembling the front-end components of
the BMX single dish, I acquired S11 measurements on both polarizations of the
OMT. These S11 measurements were acquired with the VNA connected to the data
ports of the OMT, and they represent the amount of power reflected back into the
VNA (i.e., the power that isn't broadcast out of the OMT+Horn and into free
space). This is equivalent to the frequency dependent transmission/reflectivity
of the OMT in response to signals entering the OMT+Horn.
