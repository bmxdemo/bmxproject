## Oct 12, 2017: Diode Troubleshooting

On Oct 06, Some strange behavior was recognized in the noise diode
system. Initially, there appeared to be two
On Oct 09, I

Additionally, we speculate that the voltage supplied to the
amps did not change, because that would not explain the changes in power that we
saw. We also speculate that the noise diode had not been connected to the OMT
before this spectrum was finished, for similar reasons. As such, the jump in power is still
unexplained.

On Sep. 22, I had to take another round of calibration data, since the gain of
the system had likely changed. The test was performed in ~75 F weather, which
corresponds to ~297 K. The spectrum was terminated at 297 K and 77 K with liquid
nitrogen. 

One possible explanation was a potential change in the DC voltage supplied to
the amp chain. The voltage on the amplifiers was increased from 2.9V in previous
tests to 3.0V by accident on 09/22. It was changed back later that day, to try
to try and deduce if changing the amplifier voltage was what changed the power
received by the OMT+Horn in the calivration test.

### Timeline:

In the data from the 20th, we can observe the change in received power. The
spectra can be found here:  ('/gpfs/mnt/gpfs01/astro/workarea/bmxdata/incoming/data/170920_1553.data')

This plot shows the power received over a single frequency bin (1300MHz) for the duration
of the test. Here is the basic description of events in the plot, from left to
right:

1) OMT+Horn on Sky (0-600)
2) Disconnected low-loss cable (600-700)
3) Terminated @ 290K (700-900)
4) Immersed terminator in LN2 (900-1100)
5) Removed terminator from LN2 (1100-2450)
6) Disconnected low-loss cable from terminator (2450-2500)
7) Reconnected low loss cable to OMT+Horn on Sky (2500-2850)
