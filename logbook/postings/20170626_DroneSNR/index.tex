\newcommand{\Dnu}{\Delta \nu}
Assume drone flies at heigh $h\approx150$m, emits power $P_e$ into
bandwidth $\Dnu$ over solid angle
$\Omega_e\approx 2\pi$, which is received by a dish of radius $r_d=2$
and is beam suppressed by $A=10^{-3}-1$ (assuming we want to measure
beam to -30dB).  Received signal power is given by

\begin{equation}
  P_S = P_e A \frac{\pi r_d^2}{h^2\Omega_e} \approx 10^{-4} P_e A
\end{equation}

The noise power is given by sum over system $T_{\rm sys}\approx 50$K
and sky $T_{\rm sky} \approx 10$K temperatures

\begin{equation}
  P_N = 2 k_b (T_{\rm sky} + T_{\rm sys}) \Dnu
\end{equation}
We want signal to be always dominated by drone, rather than the
changing sky background, etc, which implies $P_S \gg P_N$, or 

\begin{equation}
  \Dnu \ll 6\times 10^{13} {\rm Hz} A \left(\frac{P_e}{\rm 1  mW}\right)
\end{equation}

So, we are always very safely into this regime up to $A=10^{-4}$

Now say we want to map a square of $30\degree\times30\degree$
with resolution $0.1\degree$. This gives $N_{\rm pix} = 10^5$
pixels. Flying for $T=10$ minutes, this gives integration time
\begin{equation}
  t_i = \frac{T}{N_{\rm pix}}\approx 0.4{\rm s}
\end{equation}
per resolution element.

Given that we have established that noise never matters, we have SNR
that is purely ``mode counting''

\begin{equation}
  {\rm SNR} = \frac{P_S}{(P_S + P_N) / \sqrt{t_i \Dnu }} \approx \sqrt{t_i \Dnu}
\end{equation}

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, because I would have thought that
for a delta function $\Dnu$ I should have meausured the amplitude
perfectly. So I think this indicates breakdown of the ``Gaussian
field'' approximation. So, let's do two calculations:

\subsection*{Broadband signal}

With $\Dnu=500$MHz, $P_N\approx 10^{-12}$W and $P_S=10^{-7}A$W for mW
source, giving

\begin{equation}
  {\rm SNR} = 10^4 \frac{A}{A+10^{-5}}
\end{equation}
So essentially a very good SNR down to -50dB. Emitting 10$\mu$W would
give us signal to -30dB.


\subsection*{Narrowband signal}

TODO
%You want to integrate for less than $t_i$ as the drone will be
%moving. Say give it a factor of 10, giving $\delta nu=100Hz$. So the
%noise power would be
