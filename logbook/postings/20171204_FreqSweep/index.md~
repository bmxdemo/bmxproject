## Dec 04, 2017 - Frequency Sweep

### Basin Signal Generator Tests:

On 11/29/17, I repaired the noise diode by removing the indicator LED. After the
system was back to normal, there was discussion of taking a signal generator out
to the basin, and attempting to broadcast a tone into the dish to see if we
could measure a controlled source of RFI.

On 12/01/17, Paul S, Paul O, Justine, and I ventured out into the basin to
perform these tests, around 9:30 - 11:00 AM. The file in which these tests were
performed is '171201_1514.data'. The easiest way to interact with this data is
via the [BMX data browser](http://www.cosmo.bnl.gov/www/bmx/databrowser/).
