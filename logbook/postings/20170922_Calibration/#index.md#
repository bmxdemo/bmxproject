## Sep 22, 2017: Calibration Measurements with Liquid Nitrogen

On Sep. 20, I took calibration spectra with a terminator at 290K and 77K, and
during my calibration spectrum file, some interesting changes
occurred. Initially, the power received from the sky was quite low but by the
end of the test, it had increased by a factor of 3. Further investigation found
that the cable connections were all secure, so there didn't seem to be any
problem there. 

Additionally, we speculate that the voltage supplied to the
amps did not change, because that would not explain the changes in power that we
saw. We also speculate that the noise diode had not been connected to the OMT
before this spectrum was finished, for similar reasons. As such, the jump in power is still
unexplained.

On Sep. 22, I had to take another round of calibration data, since the gain of
the system had likely changed. The test was performed in ~75 F weather, which
corresponds to ~297 K. The spectrum was terminated at 297 K and 77 K with liquid
nitrogen. 

### Timeline:

In the data from the 20th, we can observe the change in received power. The
spectra can be found here:  ('/gpfs/mnt/gpfs01/astro/workarea/bmxdata/incoming/data/170920_1553.data')

This plot shows the power received over a single frequency bin (1300MHz) for the duration
of the test. Here is the basic description of events in the plot, from left to
right:

1) OMT+Horn on Sky (0-600)
2) Disconnected low-loss cable (600-700)
3) Terminated @ 290K (700-900)
4) Immersed terminator in LN2 (900-1100)
5) Removed terminator from LN2 (1100-2450)
6) Disconnected low-loss cable from terminator (2450-2500)
7) Reconnected low loss cable to OMT+Horn on Sky (2500-2850)

Notice the factor of 3 change in the sky spectra from the beginning to the end
of the calibration process. 
 
### Uncalibrated Spectra:

Here we will first consider the spectra from the 20th.
Note the obvious increase in power, between the blue and cyan curves.

Now compare the uncalibrated spectrum for the 22nd.

The spectra can be found here: ('/gpfs/mnt/gpfs01/astro/workarea/bmxdata/incoming/data/170922_1735.data')
Here is a plot of the uncalibrated spectra, from the sky and with the
terminators at the two previously stated temperatures.

### Calibrated Spectra:

This spectra has been calibrated using the same approach as was described in
previous [posting.](../20170906_sans_RFI_calibrated_spectrum/index.md)

### Ratio of the gain measurements:

Additionally, Anze was interested in the ratio of the gain for previous
calibrations. Hypothetically this will tell us how the amplifiers have changed
over time, and reveal if there is some change in the gain of the amp chain,
which would explain the mystery factor of 3 discussed earlier.

First is a plot of the gain arrays themselves:

And here is the ratio of these gain arrays:
