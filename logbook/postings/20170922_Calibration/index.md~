## Sep 22, 2017: Calibration Measurements with Liquid Nitrogen

On Sep. 20, I took calibration spectra with a terminator at 290K and 77K, and
during my calibration spectrum file, some interesting changes
occurred. Initially, the power received from the sky was quite low but by the
end of the test, it had increased by a factor of 3. Further investigation found
that the cable connections were all secure, that the voltage supplied to the
amps did not change, and the noise diode had not been connected to the OMT
before this spectrum was finished. As such, the jump in power is still
unexplained.

On Sep. 22, I had to take another round of calibration data, since the gain of
the system had likely changed. The test was performed in ~75 F weather, which
corresponds to ~297 K. The spectrum was terminated at 297 K and 77 K with liquid
nitrogen. 

### Uncalibrated Spectra

The spectra can be found here: ('/gpfs/mnt/gpfs01/astro/workarea/bmxdata/incoming/data/170922_1735.data')
Here is a plot of the uncalibrated spectra, from the sky and with the
terminators at the two previously stated temperatures.

It seems that there is only one line, but in fact, all the lines are essentially
identical. Regardless of the position of the aluminum sheet, the reflected signal
was essentially constant. The resolution of this data is not very good, and
redoing the measurements with a higher resolution may be useful.

Comparing these results to the aforementioned posting, we can see loose overall
consistency between the previous measurements, and the actual beam in the basin.
Again, a higher resolution measurement will likely yield better results.

### S21 Measurements

Additionally, the S21 Parameter was measured through the entire amplifier chain,
with (3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+6+10+10) = 62 dB of attenuation.
Port 1 was connected to the attenuators, then the low-loss cable.
Port 2 was connected first at the end of the ~15ft coax that runs to the
spectrometer, but in the second measurement, the coax was removed.

In the plot below, I added back the 62dB of attenuation at all points:
