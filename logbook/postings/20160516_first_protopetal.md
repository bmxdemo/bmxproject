 Justine provided the mirrored ramp support pieces and the full set of "tee" sheet support pieces, for two intermediate locations in each interval; and Evan, Amina and I got the whole thing together this afternoon.  We then made a series of measurements, looking at the height of the (bottom of) the sheet above the diagonal spacer bar across several locations.  The results for the upper three intervals are shown in the attached graphs.  In each case, the colored curve represents where the sheet height should ideally be according to the mathematical model, while the  dots are the measured heights at intervals along the bar (figure about a +/-0.5mm measurement uncertainty, and these are only along the left edge of the petal).  The arrows show the locations of the new tee support pieces along each sheet.

As you can see from the graphs the sheet position is pretty good, within a millimeter or so of the ideal; except for a noticeable "sag" in the middle of the 4-5 interval and a slightly smaller one in the middle of the 2-3 interval.  These correspond to the width of the span between the tee supports: the 4-5 is about 56cm between supports and sags about 3mm low; the 2-3 spans over about 40cm and sags about 2mm; while in 3-4 the tee spacing is only 30cm and doesn't show any visible sag in the middle.  I think this is giving us a measure of how floppy the sheet is under its own weight between clamps, and you can even see the effect in the photo if you look closely enough.

  Now, a defect of 2-3mm over a part of the surface is within our original goal of 5mm accuracy, so we can simply declare victory at this point if we want to. Note that this assembly was with no fine-tuning or pulling of any kind; the sheets were just laid down naturally on the supports and screwed down with no internal tension, which is what we would want for the production assembly.  I am thinking, though, that it would be worth the small amount of additional effort and plastic to add one more support tee for the middle of at least spans 4-5 and 2-3, which should suffice to bring the whole surface to within +/- 1mm of ideal. That's a nice, conservative starting point to be at before bringing the assemblies out into the wild.

  I'll be away all next week, and during that time I invite Justine to have a look at the setup and see what she wants to recommend next.  Meanwhile, Mike I think you can go ahead and drill and pin the side plane diagonals whenever you want to, as it stands now, though there's no rush on this.  Note, that we are still wide open to any and all ideas about how to survey the sheet shape from an external vantage point, let us know if you have any (actionable) suggestions.
