## Oct 2,  2017: Temperature Measurements using a Thermistor

Currently, the noise diode is in thermal contact with a thermistor and attached
to the Y-polarization calibration port on the OMT. Using the LabJack T7, we wish
to supply a fixed current of 200uA, and record the DC voltage drop
across the thermistor. By dividing this voltage measurement by the fixed
current, we can determine the resistance in the thermistor and hence its temperature.

On Sep. 29, I identified the thermistor in question as a mouser electronics 10K
NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor, stock number 334-42103. the
operating specifications for this thermistor can be found at the following url:

Unfortunately, I was unable to locate this thermistor in their catalog.

### Beta Parameter Equation:

To model the response of the thermistor to variation in temperature, I used the
Beta Parameter Equation.

This thermistor has a Beta parameter of 4200, and a resistance of 10kOhms at 25
C. The following plot shows the relationship between Resistance and Temperature:

### Temperature variation with time:

To examine the variation in resistance and temperature I first examined a single
data file,
