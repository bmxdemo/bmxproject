## Nov 17, 2017 - System Behavior in Inverted State

### Current Configuration:

As before, the OMT+Horn is connected via low-loss cable to the output port of a
30dB coupler operating in reverse. The noise diode is connected to the 30dB
port. The input port of the 30dB coupler is connected via low-loss cable to the
amplifier chain as follows:

BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> 3ft Cable -> BP -> Data Cable

This data cable connects to a 3dB attenuator, which is attached to the digitizer
card port.

### Data Acquisition from 171107 - 171110:

In my [last posting](../20171106_ResolvedPortIssues/index.md) I determined that
the digitizer card/spectrometer was functioning properly after some initial
hiccups. I allowed the data acquisition to run over the weekend, and examined
the data the following wednesday. The time series of this data acquisition seems
to favor the 'Inverted State', where the collected spectra do not reflect the
expected signal. In order to examine any correlated changes, I plot both channel
1 (SKY) and channel 2 (Terminated inside the front-end box).

The plotted frequency bins are:

1) f1300 = 1274.62MHz - (Green)
2) f1500 = 1301.48MHz - (Red)
3) f2000 = 1368.62MHz - (Blue)
4) f3000 = 1502.89MHz - (Cyan)

**Figure 1: Time Series of Spectrometer Acquisitions (11/07) - (11/10)**

The important plot is the channel 1 behavior, which contains the data from the
OMT+Horn on sky, with the noise diode. It should be clear that the system is
predominantly residing in the 'Inverted State', but something interesting
happened when it made some transitions between states.

Observe the transition from the 'Stable State' to the 'Inverted State' at
approximately 3.0 on the MJD axis. Zooming in for a closer look:

We can see the system inverts slowly, instead of an instantaneous change, as
typically observed in the past. 









After restarting data acquisition, I found the shape of the spectra had returned
to its former glory, and that the total power was reduced by a factor of 2 from
the initial level from my last posting, due to the added 3dB attenuator. This
discovery rendered the SignalHound measurements moot, but they indicated that
the amplifier chain was operating as expected.

### Spectrometer Data Acquisiton from 11/06:

This time series plot shows the data files collected on 11/06 in the process of
debugging the system:



I was convinced that I had destroyed the card ports, and I sought to prove
it by comparing spectra collected with the digitier card to spectra generated
with the SignalHound. 

The first measurements I took were sky spectra and terminated spectra collected
with the spectrometer, before altering any other connections.  The first data
file (LEFT in plot below) starts with the sky spectrum, after which I
disconnected the OMT+Horn from the 30dB coupler output port, and terminated the
port instead.

After this test concluded, I disconnected the data cable from the spectrometer
card, and repeated these measurements using the SignalHound, hence the gap in
the plot below.

As previously stated, I restarted the data acquisition after I reconnected the
data cable to the spectrometer, with the attenuator in place. The second data
file (RIGHT) shows the system operating at much higher power than the initial
files. I believe this is because the attenuator actually made a connection to
the digitizer card port, whereas the cable previously must not have been
adequately connected. 

This power surge led me to believe that the system had returned to the state
shown in the beginning of the last posting, and that the digitizer card was
operating as expected. That comparison is difficult to depict, but I have
attempted to show it here. 



The 4 curves on the left of the image are the tail end of the data collected on
10/27, (displaced by 9 days on the MJD axis!!). 
The 4 curves on the right are the same as the plot shown in figure 1 of
this posting.

Note that the low power values in the middle of the plot are of comparable
power. Additionally, note that the final power values (RIGHTMOST) are a factor
of 2 lower than the (LEFTMOST) initial high power values, due to the addition of
the 3dB attenuator.

So yes, the cause of much of my anxiety was due to a faulty cable connection... 

### Spectra from 11/06:

Further evidence that this connection was the issue can be observed in the
spectra from these data files. 

**Figure 3: Spectra from before and after fixing the data cable connection**

The low power spectrum clearly matches the spectra seen from the low power state
of the previous few days, and the high power spectrum shows the features we
typically see in our sky spectra.
