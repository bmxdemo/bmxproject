### June 30, 2017 - Acrylic absorption measurements

Chandler Conn

### Introduction

In my [last posting](../20170628_Acrylic/index.md) I measured the reflectivity of the acrylic sheet and found it to be essentialyl negligible. However, it came to my attention that the absorption might also play a role in signal reduction, so this post is dedicated to measuring S21 to find the acrylic absorption.

### Absorption

The absorption was measured through the S21 parameters. The plots are below, accompanied by experimental photos. The reason why the change in S21 can be interpreted as just the absorption is because we showed in the [last posting](../20170628_Acrylic/index.md) that the reflectivity plays almost no part, so adding acrylic should only change S21 because of absorption.
