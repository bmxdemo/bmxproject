It turns the white house is out of question, since the water treatment
plant use it for storage (uhm, seems they are storing gym equipment)
and more importantly they lock the fence out of working hours and are
unwilling to give us the keys, but we need access to the instrument
24hours. So, surprisingly efficient people at F&O have given us three
options, which Paul and I went to have a look at.
### Shallow dry pond

- Close to white house, flat ground, can get electricity from water treatment plant.

### Overflow basin
- http://www.bnl.gov/maps/point.php?Lat=40.86994&Lng=-72.86611
- The overflow basin for meteoric water, but apparently it hasn't been  flooded for many years, as long as people remember. It is some 10-20m deep and therefore it should offer significant RFI shielding. This
  could potentially be even an issue, since the walls are quite steep. There is a small hut there, which has electricity and maybe even network.

### Woods near pump well
- http://www.bnl.gov/maps/point.php?Lat=40.85342&Lng=-72.89051
- This is on the other side of the lab. Most likely it would be worse,
  but might be better.
