## Oct 25, 2016: Directly measured screw locations w.r.t. photogrammetry

Figure 1 shows the 3D point cloud from [Evan's posting](https://github.com/bmxdemo/bmxproject/issues/9#issuecomment-252121391) imported into solidworks. We were able to measure the distance in the model between various pairs of screw heads and compare to measurements of the actual dish using our expensive, 2m long ruler. Results are in the next posting from Evan. 

It should be noted just how ragged the screws actually look, though. Figure 2 shows a zoom in. It is clear that it is not really localizing them very well.
