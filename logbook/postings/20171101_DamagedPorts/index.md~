## Nov 1, 2017 - Damaged Digitizer Card Ports

### Palantir 2 Channel Card Status:

Some time within the past few weeks, I damaged the SMA connections that are
soldered to the digitizer card. I clearly failed to properly connect the cables,
and then damaged the connectors by securing the nuts.

The card is the 2 channel digitizer card, which only had one stable channel (chan1). We
believe that one of the (chan 2) ADCs is not properly functioning, and is causing the
gain to fluctuate when we restart the data acquisition.

Only channel 1 is operational for looking at sky data, and data has been
collected from 10/24/17 to today, 11/1/17. 

### (10/24 - 10/26) 

The data acquisition was as before, taking 1000 samples (2min) of data
repeatedly, and restarting the data acquisition after each file. We observe that
the system was relatively stable in the current configuration with the noise
diode mounted via 30dB coupler.

There are some stability issues observed in this data, around 2.25 to 2.7 on the
mjd axis. These data show some shifts near the end of this time period, but a more obvious
example will be discussed later.

### (10/28-10/29)

We wanted to further pin down a faulty ADC as the culprit behind the gain
switching, but in the process of conducting that test, I noticed the damaged
ports on the digitizer card. Progress was halted, and the computer was returned
to the physics building.

This image was sent around by email, and shows the damage to the digitizer card:

The impacted ports were opened back up using a round tipped set of tweezers, to
delicately push the petals apart.

The gain state here looks like the well behaved state observed in [Chris's
posting](../20171004_state_changes/index.md). The amplitude differs slightly,
because the loss from the coupler is 30dB rather than 24dB of the OMT coupler.
