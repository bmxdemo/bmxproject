## June 14th, 2018: OMT S-11 Lab Measurements of OMTs

On June 12th, 2018, I measured the S11 parameter on the new OMTs that I
constructed using the VNA. We can compare these measurements to 
[OMT S11 data previously collected by chris](../20170321_new_omt/index.md), both in a lab
setting with the OMT directed into an absorber, and created in simulations. This
will tell us whether the new OMTs are operating consistently with the previous
one, which is especially important due to some damage sustained by the OMT
pieces in transit.

### S11 Measurements

The OMT was positioned in the lab pointed into the absorber box, and connected
to the VNA through Channel 1, using first the X polarization connector and then
the Y polarization connector. Each OMT(A, C, D), was measured in both
polarizations, and compared to one another. This gives a reader of the amount of
reflection coming back from the OMT, or the measurement of the power recieved
back from port 1 that had been given off from port 1. OMT A had already been constructed
and measured, so we can compare the three to see how similar their output is.

It seems that there is only one line, but in fact, all the lines are essentially
identical. Regardless of the position of the aluminum sheet, the reflected signal
was essentially constant. The resolution of this data is not very good, and
redoing the measurements with a higher resolution may be useful.

Comparing these results to the aforementioned posting, we can see loose overall
consistency between the previous measurements, and the actual beam in the basin.
Again, a higher resolution measurement will likely yield better results.

### S21 Measurements

Additionally, the S21 Parameter was measured through the entire amplifier chain,
with (3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+6+10+10) = 62 dB of attenuation.
Port 1 was connected to the attenuators, then the low-loss cable.
Port 2 was connected first at the end of the ~15ft coax that runs to the
spectrometer, but in the second measurement, the coax was removed.

In the plot below, I added back the 62dB of attenuation at all points:
