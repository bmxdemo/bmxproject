## June 22, 2017 - OMT Tone Stability plots and acrylic reflection (S11) measurements
Chandler Conn

### Introduction

In this amalgamation, I present two unrelated data sets: the first of these sets is a measurement of the stability of the OMT measurements in response to a tone generator, while the second is a measurement of the reflectiveness of two thicknesses of acrylic when placed in front of the OMT. This entry is a work in progress and will most likely be finished by Friday, as now I am just focused on entering the plots for others who are interested to see.
