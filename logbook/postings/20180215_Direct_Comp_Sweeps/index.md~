## Feb 15, 2018 - Direct Comparison of Bench & Basin RFI Environments
### Motivation: Too Many Unstable Parameters!

Over the past several weeks, I have attempted to perform frequency sweep tests
both on the bench and in the basin, and the results have been rather
inconsistent. The goal was to examine the response of our OMT/Amplifiers/Filters
to a low frequency sweep at high power, specifically looking for power mixing
and intermodulation products appearing within the band. 

### Experimental Configuration:

These frequency sweeps were all performed using the Spartant signal generator
(with 2 Low Pass filters on the RF output, to attenuate high frequency harmonics
by ~80dB,) locked to the 10MHz signal output by a lab signal generator  which
also clocked the ROACH FPGA. The frequency sweeps were all performed from 25MHz
- 600MHz with a 1MHz step, at a power of +13dBm. To keep our system consistent,
I performed these tests using the amp chain I constructed on the bench, with a
2.9V supply. The amp chain is arranged as it has been in the past, and is
identical to the amp chain on the bench:

~~~
  -------------------------
  OMT/Terminator/Spartant+2LP
  -------------------------
  Band Pass Filter 1
  LNA 1 	
  3dB Attenuator
  LNA 2	
  Low Pass Filter (VLFX-1350)
  Stage 3 Amplifier
  [**When OMT, attach 10dB Attenuator**]

The difference between these tests were
limited to the  physical location (and hence RFI environment)
