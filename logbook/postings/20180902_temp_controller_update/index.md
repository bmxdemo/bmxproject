## September 02, 2018: Updates on Temp Control for New Front End Boxes 
In the current state I have left them, 3 of the new front end boxes are fully assembled with most of their physical components and their software running properly. The last box is missing a filter on one of the amplifier chains and one of the microcontrollers is acting up (presenting with an issue diagnosed on the GUI: Object temperature measurement error, External ADC supply voltage out of range <-5% < AVDD <+5%). I have not seen this issue before and could not resolve the cause, I have sent an email to the manufacturing company MeerStetter in order to get an opinion from them. Currently, on the other three boxes, the main work has been trying to improve the stability of the system by heat sinking everything as optimally as we can. The temperature logged unfortunately putters out after a few hours, but the few hours of data we get can be looked at as we move things around.
