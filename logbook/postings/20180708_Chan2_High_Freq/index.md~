## July 08, 2018 - High Frequency Slope on Channel 2

### Introduction and Problem:

Shortly after the opening salvo in my ongoing war with the wasps, I realized
that I had left a survivor alive. A small hive was clinging to life inside the
electrical outlet cover. I dispatched their dwelling with a foaming liquid
spray, but this victory was not without consequence. The liquid justice tripped
the ground fault circuit interruptor, rendering the BMX instrument without power
for approximately 3 days, after which the system began to display odd behavior
on channel 2 in response to transiting satellites. 

This behavior began on May 24, 2018 when the system was restarted. The first
data file where this behavior begins is '180524_1547.data', though it may be a
coincidence that this happened after killing the daq with wasp spray. It seemed
like things were fine for quite some time, but consulting my satellite script I
found the received power at high frequencies was higher than it should have
been. Here is one example, from June 5th.

The top row of plots shows the satellite transit spectra in blue, and the
spectra in the absence of signal in green. The system appears to have normal
levels of power at high frequency in the absence of a satellite, but there is an
unusual response to the satellite. This is more apparent in the following plots,
which are the subtracted satellite signal, shown in the bottom panels of this
figure.

The bottom panel of this plot shows the data in log-space, where it is clear
that the added power at high frequencies is an order of magnitude higher than
the power seen on channel 1. At first I thought it was a problem with my
summation methods, but turning to the data browser I verified that the satellite
transit had this appearance on channel 2, but not channel 1.


Here is a rough timeline of events in this saga:
'180522_1400.data' Spray wasps
'180524_1547.data' High frequency response has slope
'180628_2227.data' S21 Test of system, restart daq and problem is gone...?

While working on the satellite spectra plots, I kept encountering a problem with
channel 2 data.
