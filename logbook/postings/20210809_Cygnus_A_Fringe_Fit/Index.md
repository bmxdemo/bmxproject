Dr. Slosar and I have been working on fringe fits for Cygnus A. I fitted for 16 days and created plots for each of the fits. The baselines I fitted
for were 120, 130, 230, 560, 570, 580, 670, 680, 780. I also plotted the parameter values, with one plot per parameter, and I threw out values that
were too large or too small for each baseline. I also created a separate set of plots for omega, and on almost each plot are baselines of different
polarizations (ex: 120 and 560 are on the same plot). This is because there is a large range of omega values and this helps us see its fluctuations. 
However, there are is one plot where the baselines have the same polarization, but the omega values are close to each other. And the last plot only 
has one baseline.
