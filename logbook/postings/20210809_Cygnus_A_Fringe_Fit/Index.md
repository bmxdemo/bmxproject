Dr. Slosar and I have been working on fringe fits for Cygnus A. 16 days were fitted for and plots were created for each fit. The baselines fitted for were 120, 130, 230, 560, 570, 580, 670, 680, 780. The parameter values were also plotted, with one parameter per plot across the 16 days, and outlier values were thrown out for each baseline. A separate set of plots for omega were created as well, because there is a large range of omega values and this makes its fluctuations easier to see. The omega values for frequencies 1105 MHz and 1450 MHz appear to be the same.

## Fringe Fit Plots
**Freq = 1105 MHz**

**Freq = 1450 MHz**
