## Feb 10, 2018 - Hunting for Intermodulation Products via Broadcast Tests
### Current Configuration of Front-End Components (2 Channels, once again!):

On Feb 6, 2018, I conducted the first in a long series of broadcast tests, but
failed to acquired data because BMXDAQ had been offline. While I was there, I
figured it would be a worthwhile investment of time to reconnect the second
polarization, now that the custom band pass filters had arrived. The only major
difference in the two chains is the position of the first band pass filter. Due
to geometric constraints of the breadboard supports, I couldn't fit the bandpass
inside the front end box for the Y-polarization, and it had to be attached
immediately after the 30dB coupler. Additionally, I didn't have another noise
diode ready to go, so there is a terminator attached to the 30dB port on said 30
dB coupler. We have been acquiring data for the past several days on BMXDAQ.
