201019 5AM, restarted bmx2 with default_nolj.ini that runs without (seemingly dead after storm) labjack

" ~16:30 Tent closed

201007 ~15:15 (BRS, POC, JK) Tent open. Labjack voltage does not agree with DMM, POC thinks software error. JK removed regulator board from junction box for testing. 3V power connected through terminal block connector without regulator board, PS at 4.5V 2.45A, voltage 3.4V at JB. [POC] Confirmed BNC shields common with JB housing. DVM comparison of LV at JB and at Labjack AIN give similar readings, software logging of LV from LabJack suspicious. Took measurements of platform dimensions (4.877m square with chamfered inner corners E,S,and W) and platform-platform corner distances (8.026m), implies 5.675m offsets of platform centers in each axis. CygA visibility fits give ~4.2m E-W baseline lengths, implying that dish centers may be displaced ~1.45m inward of platform centers. Measured dimensions of in-burka equipment -- maybe enough room in DV Test 32" x 32" x 32" enclosure to fit everything. Would be nice to rack mount.
 
201007 14.00-16.00 : hacked bmxdaq and now have version 10: recording 4 voltages, 12 temperatures and synching diode with write cycle

" 16:29 Tent closed.

" 16:20 4.5V 2.450A at PS, 3.5V at JB (Will be more voltage drop before amps, set for high end of 3.3-3.5V range at JB. Concerned current draw still low. Sign still not enough V at amps?)

" 16:16 4.4V 2.414A at PS, 3.4V at JB

" 16:10 3.8V 2.184A at PS, 2.9V at JB

" 16:05 N,S,E,W horns on. 3.3V 1.987A at PS, 2.5V at JB

" 15:59 N,S,E horns on. 3.3V 1.551A at PS, 2.7V at JB

" 15:55 N,S horns on. 3.3V 1.079A at PS, 2.8V at JB

" 15:51 Agilent E3633A PS on. North horn powered on. 3.3V 0.572A at PS, 3.0V at junction box

" 15:15 3V power supply off 

200930 15:14 EST (BRS): Tent open

200930 17:35 EST (BRS): 3V power connected, tent closed, Labjack now monitoring voltage on 3V line at junction box on top of tower.

200930 15:22 EST (BRS): 3V power to horns disconnected.

200930 15:15 EST (BRS): Tent open. Do we see increase in RFI when this happens?

200924 16:40 EST (BRS): Reconnected power to north and south horns.

200923 12:27 EST (BRS): Disconnected 3V power to north and south horns, reconnected power to east and west horns.

200922 12:25 EST (BRS): Disconnected 3V power to east and west horns.

200910 18:39 EST (BRS): Went to power cycle low voltage power supplies, observedwater inside tent. Power supplies left off.

200910 17:00 EST (BRS): GFCI reset after rain.

200909 17:50 EST (JH): WY terminated w/ 50 Ohms. Regulators showing symptoms of overload. 2.8V with one cable disconnected, 3.05V with two, 3.3V with three, and 3.31V with four.

200909 16:15 EST (POC): Tent stable, door clips intact, fan running, LEDs on, nosign of moisure on tent floor.

200903 6AM AS, restarted after summmer, low voltage, new PS without voltage regulator

200424 7AM AS, restarted with sample counter in each file header to ease alignment.

200421 12-3pm  POC,PS, moved dishes back in place 

200415 6:00PM? AS, back to gettimdofmjd timestaping

200413 4:50 PM AS, changed MJD timestamping back to time but with gettimeoday call before that

200412 5.40 AM AS, changed MJD timestamping to int(gettimeofday) to exampine what is happening

200407 6.45 AM AS, stopped DAQ, fixed MJD stamping, restarted and calibrated delay and restart writing.

200313 4.00 PM SM, reinstalled front end regulators with a new custom board designed by Shree Murthy

200214 1:20 PM ES, removed front end regulators again and connected lab supply directly. Voltage on supply set to 3.3v.

200128 4:40 PM EST, adjusted lab supply supplying power to DC dist. box (regulators) up from 3.2v to 4.2v. Forgot to do this yesterday when the regulators were installed. Output to amps as measured is 3.34V.

200127  4:30PM EST (approx. time),reinstalled DC distribution box with four TPS7A54EVM-006 low noise voltage regulators for outputs to amp chains.

200127 11:00 AM EST (approx. time), disconnected DC distribution box which had been configured to power the amp chains directly from the lab suppy.

190409  08.05 EST, restarted with a second cut centered on galactic 21cm

190408  09.20 EST, stopped writing, calibrated delay, restarted synchronized writing

190406  21.05 EST restarted with new daq.out default.ini, but no delay calibration


190406  10.28 EST restarted with all daq in bmxdaqOLD using git commit 89bb3b0c3a1774a403022bf15e92c3addfb14c13
   	from Nov 10 2017 with some old basin.ini, but without LJ.
	
190318  1:20 PM EST, restarted integration with default2.ini that has 2048 bins @ 33ms, but uses old style `buf_mult`, `cuda_streams`, disabled `ring_buffer`

190228  3.25 PM EST, changed integration to 122ms samples of 4096 bins across the band as before. Remembered over night we can actually do 122ms if we lower number of GPU threads and forferit ringbuffer. See also 190227 5PM. (AS)

190228	2:30 PM EST, changed base supply to test distribution box, regulator appears operational with full load,
	28V supply still using BNC T-splitters on tower

190227  5.00 PM EST, changed integration to 33ms samples of 256 bins across the band to test for strange noise behaviour.             Cannot do 122ms any more, because I run of out memory (perhaps if we disable cross-corrs). (AS)

190227  2:00PM EST, disconnected north OMT, Y-pol found shorted, removed horn

190225	1:30-3:00 PM EST, reinstalled junction box and operating with regulated supply, measured 2.7V at regulator output
	3:00-3:30 PM EST, switched back to unregulated supply with BNC T's (JW)

190222  11:30AM-1:45PM EST, north Y-pol OMT cable replaced
	2:10-4:30PM EST, Y-pol back to old cable, switched X and Y connections at the north OMT
	4:40PM EST, Back to nominal setup (DZ)

190219  2:30-4:00 PM EST, north amps disconnected for S21 measurements (DZ/JW)

190214  9:45 AM EST, restart with delay calibration and n_sigma_null = 5 again (AS)

190211  11:45 AM EST, turned off RFI rejection by setting n_sigma_null = 99999 (CDS)

190205  Increased unregulated supply to 3.86V (as seen on supply display) resulting in 3.1V at the terminal blocks.
	Messed with the supply between 1pm and 3pm (EST) as I took measurements, so don't use this data.

190205	Distribution box temporarily removed to test new voltage regulator (2:30 PM EST)
	Box replaced with male/female BNC splitters to keep BMX running
	
190203  Switched back to unregulated power. Something's wrong with the new regulator. ~12:30 PM EST

190201  Junction box reinstalled. Switched to regulated power. ~2:00 PM EST

190119 17:00 UTC - Return to observing on sky with new 4 dish configuration

190131  Junction box removed for new regulator install.	~11:00 AM EST




	


=====================================================
Entries prior to 2019 not in reverse chronological

170801	  BMX Demonstrator is operating in the basin with LargeDishPetals
	  CH1: OMT -> low-loss -> LNA1 -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP
	  CH2: OMT -> low-loss -> LNA1 -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP

170830	  Basin tests indicate high RFI environment, desire filtration up-front

170831	  BMX Demonstrator is operating in the basin with Unjoined Dish
	  CH2: Sky -> LNA -> BP -> LNA -> Low Pass -> AMP3 -> BP -> Spectrometer

170907	  BMX Demonstrator is operating in the basin with Joined Dish
	  Calibrated spectra before/after joining dish show improvement
	  CH2: Sky -> LNA -> BP -> LNA -> Low Pass -> AMP3 -> BP -> Spectrometer

170920	  BMX Demonstrator is operating in the basin with Joined Dish
	  Addition of noise diode and thermistor on OMT calibration port
	  S21 Measurements for cal port indicate -25 dB coupling
	  Noise diode was emitting very high power, despite this coupling

171002	  Comparison to weather reports suggest thermistor working properly

171004	  First 'discovery' of state changes: Noise diode pulse height changing abruptly 

171009	  BMX Demonstrator is operating in the basin with Joined Dish
	  To reduce state changes, we insert padding (3dB atten) into amp chain
	  To exclude possible RFI, put filter in front of first amp:
	  CH2: Noise Diode on cal port with/without 10dB attenuator
	  CH2: OMT+Horn -> low-loss -> BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP
	  CH1: Terminator -> LNA -> LNA -> LP -> Amp3

171012	  Noise Diode is not properly functioning, occasionally disappears
	  Removal of 10dB attenuator improved diode performance
	  pulse height of diode varies as expected with different atten. values
	  Likely due to coupling problem with calport? (WT 180424)
	  Found that restarting daq could change background power level
	  6:30PM - run daq with 1000 samples (2 minute acquisitions?)

171016	  Running data acquisition looking @ terminator through 30dB coupler
	  CH2: term -> 30dBCoupler(+NoiseDiode) -> low-loss -> BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP
	  CH1: Terminator -> LNA -> LNA -> LP -> Amp3

171020	  Suspecting the digitizer as the source of background fluctuation, we switch channels
	  CH1: term -> 30dBCoupler(+NoiseDiode) -> low-loss -> BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP
	  CH2: Terminator -> LNA -> LNA -> LP -> Amp3
	  This revealed that CH2 has faulty background level that is inconsistent?

171027	  BMX is now back on sky
	  CH1 = YPOL at this time!
	  CH1: OMT -> low-loss ->  30dBCoupler(+ND) -> low-loss -> BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP
	  Digitizer ports are damaged at this time

171101	  Damaged ports are 'fixed' and we return to observations on sky
	  Improper cable connection at the PC makes data from this period useless

171106	  BMX is back online after previous cable connection issues
	  Added 3dB attenuator at digitizer card port to minimize connections at PC
	  CH1: YPOL: OMT+Horn -> low-loss -> Coupler+Diode -> low-loss ->
	  BP -> LNA1 -> 3dB -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> 3ft Cable -> BP -> Data Cable -> 3dB Atten
	  Data acquired at this time shows expected power level with added 3dB attenuator
	  State changes (normal vs wiggly state) appear here
	  These state changes are not like those seen previously
	  Stable diode pulse height (30dB coupler in use at this time)

171117	  Probing the system in the wiggly and normal state shows same terminated spectrum
	  Noticed slow change from normal to wiggly behavior in CH1 data

171119	  BMX Demonstrator is now operating in the regulated PC enclosure

171207	  Weird response to transiting sources is first noted
	  We know now that they are satellites, but many tests were made...

180119	  Listing of experimental configuration with power meter measurements:
	  Channel 1, Ypol shown below:
	  bench tests indicate we are operating at safe levels for amps
	  OMT -> low-loss -> 30dBcoupler(+ND) -> low-loss -> BP -> LNA1 -> 3db -> LNA2 -> LP -> Amp3 -> BP

180206	  Arrival of new Lorch Band Pass Filters --> can run both chans simultaneously

180210	In order to hunt for RFI intermodulation, we use ROACH and BMXDAQ
	While in this configuration, many broadcast tests were performed
	These tests indicated that there is minimal intermodulation products

180227	BMX is briefly used as an interferometer: NS Baseline Configuration
	CH1: XPol on OMT imaging the dish, in present location (North)
	CH2: Log-Periodic Antenna in XPol, placed 222in (South)
	Both amp chains have 2 BP filters in front of first amplifier
	At some point, we switched to EW configuration by moving Log-Periodic

180327	Adjustment of depth of coupled port coaxial cables on OMT
	Target was approximately -30dB of coupling across OMT ports
	This coupling proved to be unstable earlier, and this didn't fix the problems
	Unstable calibrated spectrum (K) at this time

180330	Usage of coupled ports was not suitable for acquiring data

  _________________________
  Data Cable
  -------------------------

180410	First attention paid to unstable noise floor on channel 2/YPol data
	Believing a faulty amplifier to be responsible prompted their replacement
	S21 remained consistent across CH2/YPol after replacing amps on Ypol
	S21 largely consistent across both channels

180417	The unstable noise floor on channel 2 / Ypol of OMT persists
	Debugging strategy is to rule out digitization as a potential source
	Switched CH1 and CH2 data cables at PC enclosure

180419	The noise floor instability moved to channel 1/Ypol
	Thus the problem is not with the digitizer
	Changes reverted at this time: CH1 = XPol, CH2 = YPol as usual again
	
180423	Anze has changed the sampling method for data acquisition:
	We place a window around the Galactic HI signal:
	The cut is 120 bins between 1420 and 1420MHz.
	It starts with this file: 180423_2053.data

180424	In an effort to identify the unstable noise floor, leads changed at OMT
	CH1 = YPol, CH2 = XPol, only switch was at OMT Output port
	This should indicate whether or not RFI or amp chain is causing problems

180501	Looking at the data browser, the instability is now on CH1
	The problem isn't the amps, but either the sky or the OMT
	Tests indicated that calibration port coax was in contact with data coax
	This was responsible for unstable noise floor
	Backing this coax out by ~1cm removed the instability
	Return to CH1 = XPol, CH2 = YPol
	
180515	Will kills wasps that are nesting on the tower platforms and toolbox
	
180517	Will removes the OMT coupled ports entirely (~6:20PM)

180522	Will trips the GFCI while spraying power outlet for wasp nest
	Power outage in the basin stops data acquisition and all processes
	prior to this outage all is working properly
	
180524	Power is returned to the basin by reseting the GFCI
	Channel 1 is working as intended
	Channel 2 has different properties at high frequencies in reduced data
	Possible explanation is malfunctioning noise diode, but not conclusive

180619  Switch to terminated inputs on both channels for stability test
	Replaced faulty(?) chan2/YPol noise diode, returned original for testing
	Terminated data acquisition runs until 180625_1400.data

180625	Return to data acquisition on sky starting with 180625_1827.data
	Performed LN2 Calibration in basin to study calibration methods
	terminated data from past week has not been 290K, or flat as expected...
	
180628	Perform second LN2 Calibration in basin
	Perform amp chain S21 measurement (fixes high frequency slope on chan2)
	High frequency slope is absent following 180628_2227.data file
	
180703	Change polarization of cable leads at the digitizer to study low-freq hash
	Chan1 port outside enclosure connects to Chan2 of digitizer card
	Chan2 port outside enclosure connects to Chan1 of digitizer card
	Xpol is channel 2, Ypol is channel 1
	Low frequency periodic RFI/hash has been present on channel 2 persistently
	Swapping the leads may suggest a cause/origin for this contamination
	low-frequency hash moved to channel 1 with Ypol data
	this suggests problem not originating in the digitizer
	
180705	LN2 cal and diode cal on palantir2 on bench for comparison with basin data
	
180710	Complete disassembly of front-end electronics on BMX demonstrator in the basin
	Carpenters are beginning their work and wanted the existing experiment out of the way
	All cables & front end enclosure removed entirely from the tower
	PC enclosure and horn/OMT remain in place
	Return internal cables to original positions, undoing 180703 changes
	Chan1 port outside enclosure connects to Chan1 of digitizer card
	Chan2 port outside enclosure connects to Chan2 of digitizer card
