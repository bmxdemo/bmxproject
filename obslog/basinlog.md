LN2 Noise temperature measurement
Configuration is full amp chain, no hybrid, terminator on end of short
rigid coax attached to low loss coax input. Output is long coax to PC
in tent beneath tower.

#First do X-pol on chan 1:
/home/bmx/olddaq/bmxdaq/data/170816_1502.data

#Second do Y-pol on chan 2:
170816_1538.data

#Connect back to horn, begin taking data:
170816_1551.data

Put perforated metal sheet in place over the horn opening
fairly well in place at 3:57pm; see some decrease in power
at all frequencies, but large peaks still clearly visible

Holding pyramid foam absorber box over the horn aperture
at exactly 4:00pm; again see some decrease, especially at
lower frequencies, but big peaks still clearly visible


# Stop taking data. Move dish behind horn. Re-take data.
# 170816_1613.data

At 4:16 pm, Will starts moving sheet metal square in front of horn.

Around 4:30 pm, turn iphone underneath dish into airplane mode and
out. Signal goes way down on each switch (!!!) then goes back up,
regardless of on->off or off->on. For instance, see just prior to
4:34, e.g.

Make phone call at 4:39. Not a huge change.

Paul using internet on his phone in front of horn makes spectrum go
wayyyyy down!

All phones powered off at 4:49 pm. No big change.

# Now hook Yagi into input X-pol of amp chain and take data
170816_1654.data

Added in 20 dB attenuation at 5pm ish

#######
Now, with 20 dB atten to the following:
(170816_1712.data)
start acquisition, do with Yagi (all moves happen *after* the 30 s
interval expires, so throw out first ~5-10 s of data.
30 s straight up
30 s N
30 s NE
30 s E
30 s SE
30 s S
30 s SW
30 s W
30 s NW

# Put dish back and restart data. At first y-pol was not hooked
# up. Hooked back up at 5:45 pm. Now x-pol looks good for some
# reason!! WTF!!!
